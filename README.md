Night theme for Zotero UI &amp; Pdf

Also adds some animations and other UI changes.

Based on the [Nord](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord) colorscheme and prior work by [Rosmaninho](https://github.com/Rosmaninho/Zotero-Dark-Theme).

This version would not be possible without the amazing work by [windingwind](https://github.com/windingwind) on the [zotero-plugin-template](https://github.com/windingwind/zotero-plugin-template).

## ✨ Features

### ◼️ Dark UI

Easier on the eyes for those late night deadlines.

You can cycle through the themes by clicking the little moon in the top-left.

NEW: you can also use the shortcute `ALT+SHIFT+Z` (`OPTION+SHIFT+Z` on mac) to cycle through the themes.

### 🌚 Dark-mode for PDF

It's the current year, we can change the colors of PDFs.
Choice between two themes: a very dark one, and one that matches the background color.

### 🔁 Quick cycle

Quickly toggle between different filters for the pdf
